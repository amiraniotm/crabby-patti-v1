# Crabby Patti vs The World!

This is an early version of my first platformer - Crabby Patti vs The World!
It is a clone from an old Mario game. Hit platforms from below to flip
enemies and then go kick them before they recover! Save your crab friends
from the evil scaly hands of corporate reptilians!

## About this version

Patti_v1 is the first version, very basic and rough, I made it while I was learning Untiy!

## Stack and specifications

I made Patti it in Unity 2022, writing on C# and using Aseprite to create all sprites and animations

## Credits
